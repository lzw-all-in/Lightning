        <h1 style="text-align:center">Lightening Server</h1>

    <p id="margin"> Hello, my vistors ~ This is a description about 
        how I build the web server just use C++11 features. My purpose is not to build a complicated one. In fact, 
        I wanna build a simple but fully functional web server. The message below is the detailed information 
        about the implementation of my server "Lightening". </p>
    
    <h2 id="margin"> Enviroment </h2>
    <p id="margin"> OS: Ubuntu 16.04.6 LTS <br> Complier: g++ 5.4.0
    </p> 
    <br>

    <h2 id="margin">Version 1.0</h2>

    <h3 id="margin">1. HTTP parser module</h3>
    <p id="margin">In my Web Server, It support GET, HEAD, POST method and http1.1 long connection. I use state machine to parse the http requests, 
        The header parsing process is shown in the figure blow. But this picture just is a sketch.
        The real parsing path will be more complicated.</p>

    <h3 id="margin">2. ThreadPool module </h3>
    <p id="margin">When the Web Server start up, it will create some threads as consumers in ThreadPool and
        the main thread as the producer. I use condition variable to control synchronization between producer and consumers. 
        Every time when a request come in, the producer will generate a task 
        and put it in the tail of "task list" meanwhile release a condition variable. Hence if there are threads wait 
        for the condition variable, the thread in the head of "wait list" will be wake up and take out a task from the "task list".
        Why ThreadPool rather than create one thread for one request ? The answer is we wanna reduce the overhead of creating and destroying threads. 
    </p>

    <h3 id="margin">3. IO multiplex </h3>
    <p id="margin"> Why I use IO multiplex ? Because we need to listen on multiple sockets. I use epoll not select or poll due to the time complexity
        and other optimizations in epoll. All the sockets I set to non-blocking mode. For the listen socket I set to LT mode and for others I set to ET
        mode in epoll. The most important flag in epoll is ONESHOT. It avoid several threads serve the same connection simultaneously.
    </p>

    <h3 id="margin">4. Reactor pattern module </h3>
    <p id="margin">Acutlly ThreadPool is a part of the Reactor pattern. The Reactor pattern means we have one main thread using multiplex IO to listen to new coming events 
        and old requests. Every time if a new event come in we register a read event in multiplex IO and if old events 
        come in we just dispatch them to the handler. In our situation the handler is a thread in ThreadPool.
    </p>

    <h3 id="margin">5. Min-heap based timer module</h3>
    <p id="margin"> Why I use timer ? Because in http1.1 we have the long connection option, thus we need to delete some timeout requests and we
        have to remove the request that connected but no data sent for a long time. Use a min heap can delete the most early timer and adjust it just 
        in O(logN) time complexity and add a timer just in O(1) time complexity. Note: We don't need to check the heap in a for loop to see whether 
        there is a invalid event or not.
    </p>
    <br> 
    <h2 id="margin">Problems and Solutions</h2>
    <h3 id="margin">1. Segmentation fault when sending a picture</h3>
    <p id="margin">This because I allocate stack memory to file buffer and the stack memory have a limitation around 1Mbytes->2Mbytes. If we
        want to allocate a bigger space, we should use dynamic allocations.</p>

    <h3 id="margin">2. Request picture failure</h3>
    <p id="margin"> This situation might happen when there are many visitors access my website. When WebServer finish others' tasks, 
        your request already timeout and then WebServer will delete it. </p>

    <h3 id="margin">3. Website icon don't refresh</h3>
    <p id="margin">Sometimes I change the icon of my webpage in Server and want to see whether it works or not. But the web browser always present the previous one.
        This because Google web browser don't request the icon everytime. When it accesses a webpage at the first time, it will request for the icon and store it locally.
    When it accesses the webpage at multiply times it won't to request for the icon unless you clean up the cache. </p>
